# Problem 3

- By using the files provided for the Chrome Extension, make some changes on the Content.js
- Extend the functionality by changing different elements of the DOM. 
- Take a look at the “developer’s mode” on your browser to get inspire about what possible elements you could change. 
- Provide a short readme file explaining your extension’ functionalities. Be creative!

# My solution
Have you ever thought of the existence of Aliens? Some people believe in them and I do believe there might be another existing creatures on Earth.

I created a simple Chrome extension which will make us experience the situation if the Earth is taken by Aliens.



We won't be able to access any internet since they will try to encrypt our human language to their own language.
<br />
To reproduce that situation, I replaced the elements that I checked through google chrome developer to random images or texts.
<br />
Also, I added a small popup link and window alert so that it displays some funny texts when the icon is clicked or we navigate the browser.
<br /> 
Hope this brings you joy because I had so much fun developing it.
