# Problem 3

- By using the files provided for the Chrome Extension, make some changes on the Content.js
- Extend the functionality by changing different elements of the DOM. 
- Take a look at the “developer’s mode” on your browser to get inspire about what possible elements you could change. 
- Provide a short readme file explaining your extension’ functionalities. Be creative!

# My solution
Have you ever thought of the existence of Aliens? Some people believe in them and I do believe there might be another existing creature on Earth.

I created a simple Chrome extension which will make us experience the situation if the Earth is taken by Aliens. The default icon is set as the head of the alien to be noticed easily.

We won't be able to access any internet since they will try to encrypt our human language to their language. To reproduce that situation, I replaced the elements (such as h1, h2, h3, etc) that I checked through google chrome developer with random images or texts. 
</br></br>

Also, I added a small popup link to display weird messages once the chrome extension icon(alien's head) is clicked to add a little razzle-dazzle.
</br></br>

This is another fun feature which will display the window alert with funny texts in it whenever we navigate the browser.

Hope this brings you a bit of a smile because I had so much fun developing it.
