# Problem 2

Create a simple note-taking app. A user should be able to
- Add a note
- Edit a note
- Delete a note
- Each note should be in a colored rectangular box. 
- Box colors can be selected from a fixed list of colors.
</br></br>

# My solution
I created a web application which a user can add, edit, delete note and change the background colour of the notes.
Each memo has a top bar which has a dropdown menu for colour choice, edit/save and delete button at the right top corner. 
</br></br>

This is the very first setting of the application, the user can start writing stuff on the textarea of the memo. There are 6 background colours(Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple) and the user can use the default background colour (beige) without changing it.
</br></br>

While editing               |  After saved

In this case, the user chose the background colour as green and still editing the memo. Once it's done, the user can click the pencil button at the right top corner to save it and click that button again for editing. So the pencil button works as an edit and save button. Once the note is saved, you can see that it has a bit more padding on the top.
