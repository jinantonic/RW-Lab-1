# Problem 2

Create a simple note-taking app. A user should be able to
- Add a note
- Edit a note
- Delete a note
- Each note should be in a colored rectangular box. 
- Box colors can be selected from a fixed list of colors.
</br></br>

# My solution
I created a web application which a user can add, edit, delete note and change the background colour of the notes.
Each memo has a top bar which has a dropdown menu for colour choice, edit/save and delete button at the right top corner. 
</br></br>

This is the very first setting of the application, the user can start writing stuff on the textarea of the memo. There are 6 background colours(Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple) and user can use the default background colour (beige) without changing it.
